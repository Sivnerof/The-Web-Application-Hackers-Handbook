The steps below are meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-authentication-bypass

After finding the admin directory at https://[SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/admin we'll see the following message:
Admin interface only available to local users

Intercept a request to "/admin" and changing the Host header to "localhost":
Host: localhost

Afterwards we'll get access to the Admin panel, intercept the request to delete Carlos, and change the Host header to localhost again.

GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
