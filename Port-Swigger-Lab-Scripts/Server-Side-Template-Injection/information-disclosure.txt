The payloads below are meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-with-information-disclosure-via-user-supplied-objects

Login credentials:
content-manager:C0nt3ntM4n4g3r

After logging in as the content manager we can edit the blog templates.

In order to find what template engine is used we can use a divide by zero error in hopes that a stack trace will be returned.

Payload: {{7/0}}
Response: ERROR, Django Stack Trace

Looking online for Django template injections we'll find a payload that returns all accessible objects.

Payload: {% debug %}
Response: Information about Django internals

One of the objects we have access to is "settings".
Looking at the online Django documentation for settings we'll find the following URL for a SECRET_KEY property:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings#secret-key

TO get the key we use the following payload:
Payload: {{ settings.SECRET_KEY }}
Response: Secret Key
